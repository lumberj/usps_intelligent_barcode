= DEPRECATED

This gem has been renamed to usps_intelligent_barcode and will no
longer be maintained.  Please switch to usps_intelligent_barcode as
soon as possible.

= USPS-intelligent-barcode

USPS-intelligent-barcode is a pure ruby gem to generate a USPS
Intelligent Mail Barcode.  More specifically, it generates the string
of characters you should print using one of the {USPS Intelligent
Barcode fonts}[https://ribbs.usps.gov/onecodesolution/download.cfm].

== FORKED FROM

This project was forked from
https://github.com/rtlong/USPS-intelligent-barcode by Ryan Taylor
Long, in order to add tests and refactor.  It is _not_ a drop-in
replacement: I renamed most methods and classes, and eliminated the
#draw method.

== INSTALL

    $ gem install USPS-intelligent-barcode

== EXAMPLE

    #!/usr/bin/env ruby

    mailer_id = '567094'
    serial_number = '987654321'
    routing_code = '01234567891'
    barcode = Imb::Barcode.new(barcode_id,
                               service_type,
                               mailer_id,

                               routing_code)
    p barcode.barcode_letters
    # => "AADTFFDFTDADTAADAATFDTDDAAADDTDTTDAFADADDDTFFFDDTTTADFAAADFTDAADA"

Thanks to Ryan Taylor Long for his original work, without which I
would have been lost in the USPS specification.
